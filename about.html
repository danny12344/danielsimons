        My name is Ollie Ellis and an aspiring Data Engineer. I recently Graduated from Imperial College London studying Electronic and Information Engineering. I am a competitive person and enjoy a variety of team sports and games including football, tennis and chess. I am fascinated by motorsport and have attended both endurance and F1 Grand Prix races. I love solving problems and was a frequent winner in my high school engineering society.

        C++ and Python as these are my two favorite languages due to the speed and control C++ gives you and python because how much meaningful code can be packed into only a few lines.
